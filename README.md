# Apple MagicMouse 2

This in an incompleted experiment for reversing Magic Mouse 2 protocol.
Just because I bought that mice and it does not work with Linux!

I strongly suggest you **NOT TO** compile any sources from this repo (mainly because I'm not a C developer and not a kernel developer at all).
Yet you might be interested in `docs/` and `dumps/` folders.

With a code here I was able to enable proper mouse scrolling (which is yay!), but I do not have enough time to finish this.

## P.S.

If you're going to create a linux patch based on this code or docs, I'll be flattered to be a co-author :)
